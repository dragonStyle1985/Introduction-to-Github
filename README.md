# Introduction-to-Github
In this lab, I'll practice the basics of interacting with GitHub. I'll practice creating a repository, making changes on the local machine, and pushing changes back to the remote repository. I use these git operations to share changes from the remote repository to the local repository and vice-versa.
This is a test in qwiklabs provided by google.
